# COP6526
This repo covers assignments for COP6526 at UCF. The assignments here familiarized me with Spark.

### Assignment 01 - Word Pair Counter
This assignment counts word pairs in a particular way.

### Assignemnt 02 - Movie Rating Estimator
This assignment works similar to a recommendor system. Movie genres were first grouped into k clusters, where k is determined using the elbow method. Afterwords, the missing user ratings for movies were estimated using the average user's rating for movies within that cluster. Finally, ALS was used.
